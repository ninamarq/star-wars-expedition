# Star Wars Expedition 🪐

Welcome to the Star Wars Expedition project! 🚀

## Description

This repository explores techniques for developing a data management system using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). The application is built using TypeScript, Next.js (leveraging app routes), and Styled Components.

To ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface, the project design aligns with the proposal available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LUmB3DVIrCS5zVME8zfeQu/Front-technical-challenge?type=design&node-id=1-8)
